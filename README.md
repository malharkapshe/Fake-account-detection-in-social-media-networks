# Fake-account-detection-in-social-media-networks
Developed an machine learning model to detects a fake accounts on social media .We use several algorithms including LSTM, ANN, Random Forest, XGB, K-means, Decision tree to train the model and comparing the different performance parameters like Accuracy,Precision,Recall,F1-score .Decision tree has maximum accuracy of 98.75%.
